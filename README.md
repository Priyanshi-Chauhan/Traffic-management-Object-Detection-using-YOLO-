# Traffic_management
The object of our project is to develop an intelligent traffic management system based on image processing and machine learning techniques to collect the traffic data(basically a video stream) and monitor accordingly to avoid big jams and accidents. It will provide a distributed way of traffic maintenance and detects the traffic density and chaos level too.
